In order to do this, it may be better if I divide the claims into groups according to a clear title and then compare which model brings me the closest result to my correct division. So  I asked chatGPT to divide the claims into 3 groups according to a clear topic and the division he made is most similar to the LDA model. \nSo i choose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for the next task.\nLDA Can be robust to noise in the data, especially when modeling topics in text documents and primarily used for topic modeling in text data, where it discovers abstract topics present in a collection of documents.",
